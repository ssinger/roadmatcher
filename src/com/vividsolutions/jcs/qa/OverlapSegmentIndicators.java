/**
 * Creates overlap indicators for two geometries by finding all segments which
 * overlap the other Geometry.  This is more expensive than using
 * {@link OverlapBoundaryIndicators} but it is more robust.
 * One case where this is useful is where an overlap is a linestring (i.e. where the overlap is
 * too small to be computed as an area).  {@link OverlapBoundaryIndicators} will fail in this case.
 * Note that it is possible that there is an overlap in which no vertices
 * lie inside the other geometry (e.g. a star-of-david).  In this case
 * the Overlap indicators will be computed correctly, but no Overlap Size indicators will be computed.
 * However, this case should be handled by {@link OverlapBoundaryIndicators}.
